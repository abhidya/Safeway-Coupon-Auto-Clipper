**Updating the Safeway Coupon Auto-clicker Script**

If Safeway updates their website or if there are other changes that make this script non-functional, follow these steps to update and adapt the script:

1. **Inspect Safeway's Site**:
    - Navigate to `https://www.safeway.com/foru/coupons-deals.html`.
    - Use your browser's developer tools (usually by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`).
    - Examine the HTML structure and collect the updated button IDs or class names. Websites can change the structure or naming conventions of their elements over time, so identifying the new selectors is crucial.

2. **Chat with ChatGPT**:
    - Once you have the new identifiers, approach ChatGPT with a prompt, such as:
    ```
    "I have an existing Tampermonkey script for Safeway's coupon page. The site seems to have changed its button IDs. Here are the new identifiers: [Insert New Identifiers Here]. Can you help me update the script to match these changes?"
    ```
    - ChatGPT will assist in adapting the existing script to cater to the website's updates.

3. **Testing**:
    - After receiving the updated script, install it in Tampermonkey.
    - Navigate to the Safeway coupons page to see if the script functions as expected.
    - It's essential to test all aspects of the script, especially if there were significant changes on the Safeway website.

4. **Iterate with ChatGPT**:
    - If the script doesn't work as intended or if there are other unforeseen issues, don't hesitate to go back to ChatGPT. Provide specific details on what's not working so the model can assist you better.

5. **Post a Pull Request**:
    - If you have a shared repository where the script is being maintained, make sure to post a pull request with your changes. This ensures that others benefit from the updated script and can review the modifications.
    - Make sure your pull request describes what changes were made and any new behaviors to expect from the updated script.

**Remember**: The best scripts are those that are maintained and iterated upon. Websites change and evolve, so it's essential to keep scripts updated to ensure they remain functional and useful.
